        "explanation": "Time series analysis, when used for prediction, is a supervised learning task. The other options are typically unsupervised learning tasks."

        },
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures are generally more power-efficient than CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) architectures due to their simpler instruction sets."

        "choices": {
          "a": "One-time pad cipher is highly secure than Vigenere cipher",
          "b": "Symmetric key cryptography has a slow encryption process than asymmetric key encryption technique",
          "c": "Hill-cipher can be easily breakable by brute force key search",
          "d": "All of the above"
        },
        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The one-time pad is theoretically unbreakable if used correctly, while the Vigenere cipher is susceptible to cryptanalysis. Symmetric key cryptography is generally faster than asymmetric key cryptography. Hill-cipher is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, not brute force key search."
