System.out.println(obj.getX());
}
}
a. 5
b. 10
c. Compile error
d. Runtime exception
145 | P a g eAnswer: a. 5
Explanation: The x variable in the MyClass class is marked as private, which means it can only
be accessed within the class itself. In the main method, although the obj object is created, the
attempt to directly access and modify obj.x will result in a compile error. However, the getX()
method provides indirect access to the x variable and returns its value, which is 5.

d. It is performed during the code generation phase.
Answer: b. It involves the generation of intermediate code from the parse tree.
Explanation: Syntax-directed translation involves associating actions with the grammar
productions to generate intermediate code or perform other tasks during the parsing process.
820.What is the purpose of semantic rules in syntax-directed translation?
a. To define the syntactic structure of the language.
b. To assign types to the variables used in the program.
c. To perform optimization techniques on the intermediate code.
d. To define the order of evaluation of expressions.
Answer: b. To assign types to the variables used in the program.
Explanation: Semantic rules in syntax-directed translation are used to assign types to variables,
perform type checking, and enforce type compatibility rules in the programming language.
821.Which phase of the compiler is responsible for type checking?
a. Lexical Analysis
b. Syntax Analysis
c. Semantic Analysis
d. Code Generation
340 | P a g eAnswer: c. Semantic Analysis
Explanation: The semantic analysis phase of the compiler is responsible for type checking,
symbol table management, and other tasks related to the meaning and correctness of the
program.
822.What is type checking in a compiler?
a. Verifying the syntax of the program.
b. Detecting lexical errors in the program.
c. Ensuring that the operations on variables are well-defined and compatible.
d. Generating the intermediate code for the program.
Answer: c. Ensuring that the operations on variables are well-defined and compatible.
Explanation: Type checking in a compiler ensures that the operations performed on variables,
such as arithmetic operations or function calls, are well-defined and compatible based on their
declared types.
823.Which of the following is an example of a static type checking technique?
a. Type inference
b. Dynamic typing
c. Run-time type checking
d. Operator overloading
Answer: a. Type inference
Explanation: Type inference is a static type checking technique where the compiler deduces the
types of variables or expressions based on their usage in the program, without requiring explicit
type declarations.
341 | P a g e824.What is the purpose of a type symbol table in a compiler?
a. To store the types of variables used in the program.
b. To store the names of variables used in the program.
c. To store the intermediate code generated during parsing.
d. To store the syntax rules of the programming language.
Answer: a. To store the types of variables used in the program.
Explanation: A type symbol table in a compiler is used to store information about the types of
variables, functions, and other language constructs used in the program, enabling type checking
and ensuring type consistency.
825.Which of the following is an example of a type error in a program?
a. Syntax error in an if-else statement.
b. Division of a number by zero.
c. Accessing an array element out of bounds.
d. Incorrect indentation in the program.
Answer: b. Division of a number by zero.
Explanation: Division of a number by zero is a type error as it violates the semantics of
arithmetic operations and is considered an illegal operation.
826.Which of the following is an advantage of using type checking in a compiler?
a. Improved program performance.
b. Enhanced code optimization.
c. Early detection of potential runtime errors.
d. Simplified debugging process.
342 | P a g eAnswer: c. Early detection of potential runtime errors.
Explanation: Type checking helps in detecting potential runtime errors, such as type mismatches
or incompatible operations, before the program is executed, which can save time and effort in
debugging and troubleshooting.
827.What is the primary goal of type checking in a compiler?
a. To ensure syntactic correctness of the program.
b. To generate efficient machine code.
c. To enforce programming language rules and constraints.
d. To provide support for code reuse through libraries.
Answer: c. To enforce programming language rules and constraints.
Explanation: The primary goal of type checking is to enforce the rules and constraints specified
by the programming language, ensuring that the program adheres to the specified types and
avoids potential type-related errors.
828.Which of the following is an example of a type coercion or type conversion?
a. Assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable.
b. Assigning a value to an uninitialized variable.
c. Declaring a variable without specifying its type.
d. Using an undeclared variable in the program.
Answer: a. Assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable.
Explanation: Type coercion or type conversion refers to the automatic or explicit conversion of
one type to another, such as assigning a floating-point value to an integer variable, where the
value is converted to the integer type based on the rules defined by the programming language.
